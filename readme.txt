Guess The Word Game Project

In this lesson, the HTML and CSS have been given.

The goal was for me to use JavaScript to provide interaction with a user.

I wrote the scripts to fetch and utilize an API of over 800 common English Words, and randomly select one for the user to guess.

New concepts learned in this lesson are as follows: match(), split(), trim(), join(), and I used a single, simple regular expression to find text that matches a pattern.

Decomposition was used by the instructor to aid in the JavaScript build of this project.
